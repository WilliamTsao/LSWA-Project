# StreeTunes

## Overview
StreeTunes is a web based application where street musicians can store their music and create unique, single-use QR (Quick-Response), codes to share to purchasers who are interested in hearing more of their music. StreeTunes also provides extensive data and analytics about download volume so that artists can optimize their distribution efforts. A QR code is only valid for scan ONCE. Upon clicking the download link generated from a scanned QR, it's path is deleted from the database of valid paths. 

Our application helps street musicians connect to their listeners in a more modern way, but providing both the musician and their consumer a technology-friendly way to share their music. Our application will also help them reduce costs and increase business on their end since they will not have to go out of their way to buy and produce actual CDs!

There are 3 separate docker containers used, each representing a database (shard), musician_id will serve as the sharding key across all models except User and Profile (which are on auth_db).


## Important notes
Please assess app.code only under the branch "new-deployment" - this branch shows the most updated application.


## Technologies used
* Backend: Python(2.7) and Django(1.9) on Apache Webserver
* Frontend: Django templates, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Google Maps API
* Deployment: AWS (Amazon Web Services)


## Data Model
The application will store User, Profile, Album, Purchase, Song
* musicians can have multiple albums
* each album can contain multiple songs
* the purchase model represents a single purchase
* a purchase refers to one 'version' of an album -- to avoid conflicts if/when musicians change albums between QR code creation and download on consumer side
* the "version_hash" denotes the name of the zip file containing a version of that album
